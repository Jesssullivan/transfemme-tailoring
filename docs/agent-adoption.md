# Agent Adoption Flow

This is the DRY handoff for asking an AI coding agent to adopt the
`tinyland-inc/site.scaffold` contract in any Tinyland repo.

## Paste To Agent

> Adopt the Tinyland scaffold contract for this repo: read `AGENTS.md`, `Justfile`, `flake.nix`, `tinyland.repo.json` if present, `.github/workflows/*`, `.github/lanes.json`, `.bazelrc*`, `MODULE.bazel`, and `docs/CI-SCHEMA.md` if present; classify the repo shape and authority boundaries against `tinyland-inc/site.scaffold/docs/spec/tinyland-repo-taxonomy-and-gitops-contract-2026-05-19.md`; map the repo to the enforceable layers in `tinyland-inc/site.scaffold/docs/agent-adoption.md`; flag contract smells; patch only minimal conformance gaps; run through `just <recipe>` entrypoints only; validate with `just check` plus `just conformance` or the closest documented equivalent; do not remove or rewrite dirty worktrees without preserving them and reporting the stash/branch.

For plugin-capable agents, install or load the scaffold skills first:

```text
/plugin marketplace add github:tinyland-inc/site.scaffold
/plugin install scaffold-core@site-scaffold
```

If plugin install is unavailable, read these files directly from the scaffold:

- `.agents/skills/tinyland-whoami/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/tinyland-repo-contract/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/tinyland-static-spoke/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/tinyland-flywheel-bazel/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/tinyland-scaffold-doctor/SKILL.md`

## First Pass

Before editing, produce a short repo orientation:

1. Worktree state: current branch, upstream, dirty files, stashes, and all
   worktrees from `git worktree list --porcelain`.
2. Repo shape: static spoke, static-spoke scaffold, mothership/content
   authority, app/stateful spoke, package producer, package authority, infra, or
   tooling.
3. Authority boundaries: what this repo owns, what it consumes, and which
   sibling repo owns the delegated surface.
4. Enforceable layers present or missing.
5. Contract smells and the smallest patch plan.

Dirty or locked worktrees are evidence, not trash. Preserve them with a named
stash or leave them alone. Prunable worktree metadata may be reported separately
from live paths.

## Enforceable Layers

Use these layers to characterize the repo and decide what applies:

| Layer | Files | Expected shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repo contract | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tinyland.repo.json` | Clear repo role, authority boundaries, and first-read instructions. |
| Command surface | `Justfile` | Every operation goes through `just <recipe>`. CI uses `nix develop --command just <recipe>`. |
| Toolchain | `flake.nix`, `.envrc` | Reproducible shell with tools used by Just recipes. |
| Validation | `just check`, tests, schema validators | Named checks, no ad hoc untracked scripts. |
| Secrets | `.gitleaks.toml`, `just secrets-scan-dir`, `just secrets-scan` | Gitleaks default rules plus narrow Tinyland additions. |
| Bazel graph | `MODULE.bazel`, `MODULE.bazel.lock`, `BUILD.bazel` | Bzlmod graph proof and exact in-house package parity. |
| Flywheel | `.bazelrc.flywheel`, `scripts/gloriousflywheel-bazel.sh`, `just flywheel-*` | Endpoint-free config; cache/executor endpoints come from environment. |
| GitOps lanes | `.github/lanes.json`, CI workflows, dispatch schemas | Blahaj owns PR lanes, reaps, public previews, and final statuses. |
| Static projection | snapshot recipes, projection docs | Static spokes consume checked-in public snapshots only. |
| Agent ingestion | `.agents/skills/*`, `.claude/skills/*`, `static/llms.txt`, `static/agent-map.md`, `/agent` | Agent-readable surfaces link back to durable repo truth. |
| SBOM | `just sbom`, `syft`, `tinyland.repo.json` | SBOM generation is documented and ignored artifacts stay under `build/sbom/`. |

Do not apply static-spoke-only rules to `tinyland.dev` or to
MassageIthaca-shaped app repos. Org-wide rules still apply: explicit
entrypoints, reproducible toolchains, secrets scanning, CI clarity, and durable
docs over prompt-only requirements.

## Smells

Flag these before patching:

- CI or docs call `pnpm`, `vite`, `bazelisk`, `tofu`, or scripts directly where
  a `just` recipe should exist.
- No `flake.nix`, or the flake omits tools used by documented recipes.
- Validation lives only in one-off files outside `scripts/`, tests, Bazel
  targets, schemas, or Just recipes.
- `.bazelrc.flywheel` hard-codes `--remote_cache`, `--remote_executor`, upload
  authority, credentials, or cluster-local endpoints.
- Flywheel work bypasses `scripts/gloriousflywheel-bazel.sh` or `just
  flywheel-*`.
- Pull requests can upload to the remote cache without a trusted lane.
- OpenTofu, dev-server, or image-push targets are marked RBE eligible.
- Static spokes fetch `tinyland.dev` at browser or edge runtime.
- Static spokes own Cloudflare mutation credentials instead of delegating public
  previews to Blahaj.
- RustFS appears as a Tofu state backend or RBE CAS/action-cache authority.
- In-house `@tummycrypt/*` or `@tinyland/*` package versions are ranges or drift
  from `MODULE.bazel`.
- Agent-facing files disagree with each other, or requirements live only in a
  prompt.

## Conformance Patch Order

1. Add or repair `AGENTS.md` and `tinyland.repo.json` so repo shape is explicit.
2. Normalize commands behind `Justfile` recipes.
3. Ensure `flake.nix` includes every tool those recipes call.
4. Add secrets scans and schema validators.
5. Wire Bazel graph checks and Flywheel wrappers without endpoint literals.
6. Link Blahaj/GitOps contracts through CI templates instead of per-repo
   workflow duplication.
7. Publish agent ingestion surfaces only after the durable contract files are
   true.
8. Run `just check`, `just conformance`, and repo-specific build/test gates.

If a repo cannot yet implement a layer, document the gap and owner instead of
silently inventing a local workaround.
