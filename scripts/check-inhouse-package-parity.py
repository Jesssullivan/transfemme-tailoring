"""Assert Bazel-only ingestion of the in-house @tummycrypt/@tinyland packages.

TIN-2838 flipped the scaffold from an npm-shadow ingestion (org packages listed
as npm specifiers in package.json, versions kept in exact parity with the
bazel_dep pins) to Bazel-only ingestion: the org packages are graph-linked from
tinyland-inc/bazel-registry via `npm_link_package` and carry NO npm specifier at
all. The pnpm/npm path can no longer supply them.

The invariant this check enforces (conformance item 13):

  1. NO @tummycrypt/* or @tinyland/* npm specifier may remain in package.json
     (any of dependencies / devDependencies / peerDependencies /
     optionalDependencies). Any lingering specifier is npm-shadow ingestion and
     is forbidden.
  2. Every org package the repo graph-links MUST be present as BOTH a
     `bazel_dep(...)` in MODULE.bazel AND an `npm_link_package(...)` entry in
     BUILD.bazel (the two halves of a Bazel-only ingestion edge).

resolution-layer extension (2026-08-31): (1) and (2) above only prove the
*declaration* layer -- MODULE.bazel names the right module and version, and
BUILD.bazel links it. Neither ever opens MODULE.bazel.lock, so a lock whose
registryFileHashes point an in-house module at npmjs.org, or a missing lock
entirely, both passed silently before this extension -- proved by mutating a
copy of the real lock and confirming the prior version of this script stayed
green. The functions below close that: they require every in-house
bazel_dep's MODULE.bazel + source.json to be recorded in the lock under the
exact registry URL pinned in .bazelrc's `common --registry=` line, and they
self-test that requirement by mutating a parsed copy of the lock in memory
before trusting it against the real file. Paired with `common
--lockfile_mode=error` in .bazelrc, which makes Bazel itself refuse to
silently regenerate a drifted lock.

LIMITS, stated plainly -- what a green run here does NOT mean: it does not
mean the site consumes an in-house package's BYTES through Bazel at build
time; that is invariant (2) above (bazel_dep + npm_link_package). The
resolution-layer functions only prove provenance of the MODULE GRAPH's
metadata -- each in-house module's MODULE.bazel + source.json came from the
pinned registry commit, not some other host -- nothing about the shipped
package contents themselves.

Every check above depends on parse_bazel_deps(), which reads MODULE.bazel's
`bazel_dep(...)` calls kwarg-order-agnostically. That matters for safety, not
tidiness: a parser that requires `version` to sit immediately after `name`
silently drops `bazel_dep(name = "x", dev_dependency = True, version = "1.0")`,
and a dropped in-house dep is fail-OPEN here because it escapes the
resolution-layer audit entirely instead of tripping it. parser_self_test()
asserts the order-independence before any real check runs.

The report style matches the prior parity check: failures print to stderr as
`  - <detail>` bullets and the script exits non-zero; a clean run prints a
one-line ok summary and exits zero.
